# Fedigroup

Groups in fedigerse

Trying to implement: https://github.com/yuforium/activitypub-docs/issues

I saw this and thought it was cool: https://github.com/wmurphyrd/guppe
But I want to have also a way to search back in groups. For now I am aiming for public only groups.

Code contribution would be appreciated!
